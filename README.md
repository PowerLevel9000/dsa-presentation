# NEXT MEETING Exercise
- [ ] Improve Shorting hat Function For edge cases <a href="https://github.com/PowerLevel9000/dsa-presentation/blob/d6ee372ea4222fdb136a02877c597083f126613c/shorting-hat.js#L1">Click here</a>
  - For person with `third name` 
  - Two person with the same `First name` 
- [ ] Improve <a href="">`stack.js`</a> from week-2 
  - <a href="https://github.com/PowerLevel9000/dsa-presentation/blob/d6ee372ea4222fdb136a02877c597083f126613c/shorting-hat.js#L1">LastRemove</a> function is not Working. it should return the last pop element since we just mutate `count` it should be easy and it should return `you have nothing in stack` or `your stack is cleared` when stack is cleared . <b>Note here stack empty and stack cleared is two different things</b>  
  - ADD some more function like 2nd last removed 
  - a function which return last pop element whenever it called like
  ```
  const stack = [a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h]
  stack.pop() // removes h
  stack.pop() // removes g
  stack.pop() // removes f
  stack.pop() // removes e
  stack.pop() // removes d
  // our new function name could be anything you want for
  //instance reverter
  stack.reverter() // should return d
  stack.reverter() // now it  should return e
  stack.reverter() // now it  should return f
  stack.reverter() // now it  should return g
  stack.reverter() // lastly it  should return h
  stack.reverter() // lastly it  should return "no more removed items"

  ```
